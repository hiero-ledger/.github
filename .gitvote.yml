# The audit page lists all the votes recorded for the repository. It can be
# useful to provide transparency on the voting history of a repository. By
# default, the audit page is disabled. To enable it, the audit section must be
# included in the configuration file, with the `enabled` field set to true.
#
# Please note that this page is publicly accessible, so anyone will be able
# to see all votes recorded for the repository.
#
# Once you have enabled it, the audit page will be available at:
#
#   https://gitvote.com/audit/OWNER/REPO
audit:
  enabled: true

# Automation (optional)
#
# Create votes automatically on PRs when any of the files affected by the PR
# match any of the patterns provided. Patterns must follow the gitignore
# format (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).
#
# Each automation rule must include a list of patterns and the profile to use
# when creating the vote. This allows creating votes automatically using the
# desired configuration based on the patterns matched. Rules are processed in
# the order provided, and the first match wins.
#
# automation:
#   enabled: true
#   rules:
#     - patterns:

# Configuration profiles (required)
#
# A configuration profile defines some properties of a vote, like its duration,
# the pass threshold or the users who have a binding vote. It's possible to
# define multiple configuration profiles, each with a different set of settings.
#
profiles:
  # Default configuration profile
  #
  # This profile will be used with votes created with the /vote command
  default:
    # Voting duration (required)
    #
    # How long the vote will be open
    #
    # Units supported (can be combined as in 1hour 30mins):
    #
    #   minutes | minute | mins | min | m
    #   hours   | hour   | hrs  | hrs | h
    #   days    | day    | d

    #
    duration: 1w

    # Pass threshold (required)
    #
    # Percentage of votes in favor required to pass the vote
    #
    # The percentage is calculated based on the number of votes in favor and the
    # number of allowed voters (see allowed_voters field below for more details).
    pass_threshold: 66.66

    # Allowed voters (optional)
    #
    # List of GitHub teams and users who have binding votes
    #
    # If no teams or users are provided, all repository collaborators will be
    # allowed to vote. For organization-owned repositories, the list of
    # collaborators includes outside collaborators, organization members that
    # are direct collaborators, organization members with access through team
    # memberships, organization members with access through default organization
    # permissions, and organization owners.
    #
    # By default, teams' members with the maintainer role are allowed to vote
    # as well. By using the `exclude_team_maintainers` option, it's possible to
    # modify this behavior so that only teams' members with the member role are
    # considered allowed voters. Please note that this option only applies to
    # the teams explicitly listed in `allowed_voters/teams`.
    #
    # Teams names must be provided without the organization prefix.

    # Periodic status check
    #
    # GitVote allows checking the status of a vote in progress manually by
    # calling the /check-vote command. The periodic status check option makes
    # it possible to automate the execution of status checks periodically. The
    # vote status will be published to the corresponding issue or pull request,
    # the same way as if the /check-vote command would have been called
    # manually.
    #
    # When this option is enabled, while the vote is open, a status check will
    # be run automatically using the frequency configured. Please note that the
    # hard limit of one status check per day still applies, so if the command
    # has been called manually the automatic periodic run may be delayed.
    # Automatic status checks won't be run if the vote will be closed within
    # the next hour.
    #
    # Units supported:
    #
    #   - day / days
    #   - week / weeks
    #
    # As an example, using a value of "5 days" would mean that 5 days after the
    # vote was created, and every 5 days after that, an automatic status check
    # will be run.
    #
    # periodic_status_check: "5 days"
    #
    periodic_status_check: "1 day"

    # Close on passing
    #
    # By default, votes remain open for the configured duration. Sometimes,
    # specially on votes that stay open for a long time, it may be preferable
    # to close a vote automatically once the passing threshold has been met.
    # The close on passing feature makes this possible. Open votes where this
    # feature has been enabled will be checked once daily and, if GitVote
    # detects that the vote has passed, it will automatically close it.
    #
    # close_on_passing: true
    #
    close_on_passing: false

    # Close on passing minimum wait
    #
    # When the close on passing feature is activated, voting will conclude once
    # the pass threshold is met. However, there may be instances where it is
    # preferable to implement a minimum wait time, even if the vote would
    # already pass. This allows participants sufficient opportunity to engage
    # and reflect before the vote is automatically finalized.
    #
    # Units supported:
    #
    #   - day / days

    # Announcements
    #
    # GitVote can announce the results of a vote when it is closed on GitHub
    # discussions. This feature won't be enabled if this configuration section
    # is not provided. The slug of the category where the announcement will be
    # posted to must be specified (i.e. announcements).
