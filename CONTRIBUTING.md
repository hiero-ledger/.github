## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust Code of Conduct](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/code-of-conduct).

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you.
In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.
It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an Issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## Reporting Bugs Or Suggesting Enhancements

If you found a bug in our code or want to suggest a new feature or improvement please create a new Issue.

## Your First Code Contribution

We reserve issues for people who have never contributed to this project or any open source project in general.
We know that creating a pull request (PR) is a major barrier for new contributors.
The goal of issues labeled by **'good first issue'** is to help you make your first contribution.

This does not mean that contribution is only welcome for those issues.
We are happy with any contribution.
The most important point is that an issue exists for the contribution.
If that is not the case please create an issue for a bug or enhancement.
Please comment on the given issue that you want to work on it.
Once a member of the team has assigned you to the issue you can start working on it.
